# FF11-Addons
My own addons or modified. Includes both Windower and Ashita v4


## FF11-Downloader
Custom powershell script (needs to run as admin)  which will download the FF11 installation files automatically and extract them. 
Same process as you'd download each file individually. Uses Aria2 for backend. 

## Custom Lutris Scripts

See: https://github.com/sevu11/FF11-Addons/tree/sevu11-lutris-installers

Custom installation scripts for Linux for both Windower4 (updated for dotnet48) and Ashita4 (comes patched with `winefix.dll` and configured `default.txt` script)
