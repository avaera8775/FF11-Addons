# Installation
Install to your addons folder (e.g. `.\addons\hush\hush.lua`).

## Usage
* `/hush`: Opens a GUI with options for filtering certain messages.

## Horizon & Retail Support
The addon is based on the Horizon [version](https://github.com/clanofartisans/ashita-hush) made by clanofartisans.
- Added checkbox and settings for filter by keywords and a horizon option, as teleport shouts and Eco-Warrior is not relevant on retail.
